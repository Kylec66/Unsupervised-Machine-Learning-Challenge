Based on the results from the cluster scatter plot I do not believe that Crypto currencies should be clustered together. There lacks any sense of form or pattern off 
of the clusters present that would allude to any intelligent method to the maddness. These crypto currencies cluster together but do not provide any shape that would indicate patterns were present off of the data.
